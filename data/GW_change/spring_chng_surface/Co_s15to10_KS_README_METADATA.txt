Title: Groundwater Elevation Change: Spring 2010 to Spring 2015

Summary: We used CASGEM well records to create interpolated surfaces of groundwater elevation change across Solano County for Spring and Fall seasons from 2010 to 2015. We defined the Spring season measurements as the median of April measurements at each well (in cases where there were multiply April measurements), and if there were no April well records, then we used the latest measurement in March or the earliest measurement in May. To define the Fall season, we followed a similar pattern using October measurements when possible, and if not the latest in September or earliest in November. We did this analysis for all wells within a 10 mile buffer around Solano County. Next, we differenced the respective Fall and Spring measurements from wells with measurements in both 2010 and 2015, and created two datasets of groundwater elevation change per season from 2010 to 2015. We then used the Kriging tool in ArcMap (Ordinary; Spherical semivariogram model) to interpolate a surface of groundwater change from the point data. This process smooths out the actual input data points, and therefore the interpolated surface is best used to identify broad trends across the County—particularly given the small sample size given the spatial extent of the interpolation. The variance of the kriged surfaces is also presented as a separate raster file.
