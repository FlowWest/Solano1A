Notes: Created by synthesizing several water management entity boundary layers from Solano County GIS. Attributes describe water delivery, source, and for some entities, modeled applied water demand for 2010 and 2015.

GWD_10 = volume of reported delivery from groundwater sources for 2010 in units of acre-feet

SWD_10 = volume of reported delivery from surface water sources for 2010 in units of acre-feet

GWD_15 = volume of reported delivery from groundwater sources for 2015 in units of acre-feet

SWD_15 = volume of reported delivery from surface water sources for 2015 in units of acre-feet

Del_10_AF = total volume of reported delivery for 2010 in units of acre-feet

Del_15_AF = total volume of reported delivery for 2015 in units of acre-feet

prct_GW_10 = percent of total volume of reported delivery supplied by groundwater for 2010 in units of acre-feet 

prct_GW_15 = percent of total volume of reported delivery supplied by groundwater for 2015 in units of acre-feet 

Dem_10_AF = modeled agricultural water demand for 2010 in units of acre-feet (only for select water management entities)

Dem_15_AF = modeled agricultural water demand for 2015 in units of acre-feet (only for select water management entities)
